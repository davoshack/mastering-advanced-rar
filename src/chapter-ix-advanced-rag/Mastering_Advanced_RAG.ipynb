    "A  [Query Engine](https://docs.llamaindex.ai/en/stable/module_guides/deploying/query_engine/root.html)  is an advanced interface that allows interaction with data via natural language queries. It’s a wrapper designed to process queries and generate responses. Combining multiple query engines can enhance functionality, meeting the complexity of specific queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, a  [Chat Engine](https://docs.llamaindex.ai/en/stable/module_guides/deploying/chat_engines/root.html)  is suitable for an interactive experience like a conversation, as it requires a series of queries and responses. This offers a more dynamic and engaging way to interact with data.\n",

    "To create a query engine, one typically uses the `.as_query_engine()` method on generated indices. Here are the steps included in creating indexes from text files and using query engines to engage with the dataset:\n",
