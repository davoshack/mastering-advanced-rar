    "[LangSmith](https://www.langchain.com/langsmith)  is a platform for evaluating and monitoring the quality of LLM systems‚Äô outputs. Its functionality includes tracking metadata, token usage, and execution time, which is vital for managing resources effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "LangSmith improves the efficiency and performance of new chains and tools. It also provides visualization tools to recognize response patterns and trends, enhancing the understanding and analysis of performance. It allows users to create customized testing environments tailored to specific requirements, enabling comprehensive evaluation under various conditions. The platform also tracks the executions linked to an active instance and allows for the testing and assessing of any prompts or responses produced. LangSmith offers several tutorials and in-depth documentation to assist users in getting started.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, LangChain Hub is a platform designed for the development, storage, and sharing of reusable components used in building applications with large language models (LLMs). It offers a repository of modules such as prompts, chains, and agents that can be easily accessed and integrated into projects. LangChain Hub simplifies the creation of LLM-driven applications by providing tools and templates and promoting collaboration among developers.\n",
    "\n",
    "This section contains an example of how to use LangChain Hub together with a question-answering chain in LangChain. We will guide you through the setup process for LangChain, including installing necessary libraries and configuring environment variables. A LangSmith account is required for certain features like tracing. Detailed steps for setting up a new account will be provided.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, you will need an API key. Navigate to the  [LangSmith](https://www.langchain.com/langsmith)  website and register for an account. Find the option to generate an API key on the settings page. Click the ‚ÄúGenerate API Key‚Äù button to receive your API key.\n",
